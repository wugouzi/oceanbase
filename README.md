# What is OceanBase Database
OceanBase Database is a native distributed relational database. It is developed entirely by Ant Group. OceanBase Database is built on a common server cluster. Based on the Paxos protocol and its distributed structure, OceanBase Database provides high availability and linear scalability. OceanBase Database is not dependent on specific hardware architectures.

## Core features

- Scalable OLTP
   - Linear scalability by adding nodes to the cluster
   - Partition-level leader distribution and transparent data shuffling 
   - Optimized performance for distributed transaction through "table group" technology
   - High concurrency updates on hot row through early lock release (ELR)
   - 80000+ connections per node and unlimited connections in one instance through multi threads and coroutines
   - Prevent silent data corruption (SDC) through multidimensional data consistency checksum
   - No.1 in TPC-C benchmark with 707 million tpmC
- Operational OLAP
   - Process analytical tasks in one engine, no need to migrate data to OLAP engine
   - Analyze large amounts of data on multiple nodes in one OceanBase cluster with MPP architecture
   - Advanced SQL engine with CBO optimizer, distributed execution scheduler and global index
   - Fast data loading through parallel DML, and with only 50% storage cost under compression
   - Broke world record with 15.26 million QphH in TPC-H 30TB benchmark in 2021
- Multi-tenant
   - Create multiple tenants (instances) in one OceanBase cluster with isolated resource and access
   - Multidimensional and transparently scale up/out for each tenant, and scaling up takes effect immediately
   - Database consolidation: multi-tenant and flexible scaling can achieve resource pooling and improve utilization
   - Improve management efficiency and reduce costs without compromising performance and availability

## TODO (sort by priority)
1. [ ] cast_obj_to_datum
2. [ ] learn LSM-tree
3. [ ] after read a buffer, sort it directly and write back
4. [ ] parallel load data
5. [ ] how does ob manage threads?
